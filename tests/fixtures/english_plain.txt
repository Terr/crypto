NEW YORK - ONE CAR SURVIVED A SPECTACULAR CRASH IN WHICH ITS DRIVER DIED, ONLY TO BE DESTROYED BY FIRE WHEN THE GASOLINE TANK CAP WAS ACCIDENTALLY LEFT OFF. ANOTHER ENJOYED A BRIEF BURST OF GLORY WHEN IT FERRIED H.G. WELLS AROUND MANHATTAN BEFORE IT CRASHED TOO. IT WAS LEFT TO ROT IN ARIZONA UNTIL BEING RESCUED, AND RESTORED BY LOCAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS. A THIRD CAR WAS DRIVEN AROUND THE UNITED STATES TO PROMOTE THE ALLIED CAUSE DURING WORLD WAR II, THEN SOLD FOR SCRAP BY A KANSAS JUNKYARD.

THOSE ACCIDENT-PRONE VEHICLES WERE THE THREE DYMAXION CARS, WHICH WERE DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED IN BRIDGEPORT, CONNECTICUT, IN THE 1930S BY R. BUCKMINSTER FULLER, OR "BUCKY" AS HE PREFERRED TO BE CALLED.

BILLING HIMSELF AS "A MAVERICK THINKER, A GENTLE REVOLUTIONIST, A LOVEABLE GENIUS, AN ANTI-ACADEMICIAN, DOCTOR OF SCIENCE, DOCTOR OF ARTS, DOCTOR OF DESIGN," AMONG MANY OTHER ROLES, HE AIMED TO BUILD THE MOST FUEL-EFFICIENT CAR ON THE ROAD. AS YOU WOULD EXPECT OF A LOVEABLE GENIUS, MANY OF FULLER'S CLAIMS FOR HIS DESIGNS WERE WILDLY EXAGGERATED, BUT HE SUCCEEDED IN ACHIEVING HIS OBJECTIVE WITH THIS ONE.

THREE-QUARTERS OF A CENTURY AFTER THE LAST OF THE ORIGINAL MODELS, CAR #3, ROLLED OFF THE PRODUCTION LINE, A NEW DYMAXION CAR HAS BEEN CREATED, CAR #4. BASED ON THE DRAWINGS OF CAR #3 AND PAINSTAKING ANALYSIS OF CAR #2, IT WAS BUILT IN THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE IN THE EAST SUSSEX WORKSHOPS OF CROSTHWAITE & GARDINER, WHICH SPECIALIZES IN RESTORING 1930S RACING CARS. THE NEW CAR WAS COMMISSIONED BY NORMAN FOSTER, THE BRITISH ARCHITECT OF SUCH MODERN LANDMARKS AS BEIJING AIRPORT, THE NEW REICHSTAG IN BERLIN AND THE "GHERKIN" IN LONDON. A PASSIONATE CAR COLLECTOR, HE UNDERTOOK THE PROJECT AS A LABOR OF LOVE AND AN HOMAGE TO FULLER, WHO HE MET IN 1971 AND COLLABORATED WITH UNTIL FULLER'S DEATH IN 1983.
